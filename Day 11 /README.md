A **class** is a blueprint used to create objects.  
An **object** is an instance of a class that holds actual data.

## Key Points
- Class defines variables and methods
- Object is created using the `new` keyword
- Object occupies memory, class does not
- One class can create multiple objects

## Goal
Understanding the basics of Object-Oriented Programming in Java.
